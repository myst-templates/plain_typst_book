# MyST Template for Plain Typst Book

This repository, created by [Freek Pols](https://github.com/FreekPols/) and [Luuk Fr√∂ling](https://github.com/Luukfroling) provides a plain Typst book template designed for use with MyST. The template creates a PDF document as a [static export](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-static-exports); in particular, it is designed to capture the non-interactive components of website made using the book theme (bundled with MyST, see [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates#default-web-themes)). This template is designed to help authors quickly set up a structured book project with MyST, ensuring a professional layout and easy customization. The primary use case of this template is to allow authors to easily maintain a single document in two formats; in other words: a website and PDF document using the same source code.

The template features:

- **Cover page**: Includes the book title, a cover figure, and author names.
- **Preface**: Automatically generated from the `description` section in the `myst.yml` file.
- **Table of Contents**: Generated with a depth of 2 by default, can be specified in the myst.yml.

The PDF document contained in the repository in subdirectory `examples/` is generated using this template and will be updated when significant changes are made. A preview of the cover page is shown here:

## Usage

There are several ways to use this, described here briefly and non-exhaustively (to be updated or linked to MyST docs later). It is assumed you have MyST working on your computer and you can run the commands `myst build --pdf` and `myst start`.

- clone or download the repo, navigate your CLI to `./examples/` and run `myst build --pdf` to generate the PDF document; `myst start` will build the website and start a local server to view it
- clone or donwload the repo and copy the files in root to the working directory of your MyST book project; specify the directory with the files in your `myst.yml` file
- specify the GitHub repo in your `myst.yml` file as a template (include `*.git` at the end of the URL)

## Ideas

File `style.typ` defines the layout and style of the book. We specifically pay attention to the cover page by specifying the page for the cover. We subsequently define the preface page and the table of contents page. Then we define the layout for the content of the book, setting a left margin to 20%.

File `template.typ` 'reads' the content from the `myst.yml` file and makes it available for the style.typ file. 

Files `aside_style.typ` is a file that helps to convert MyST aside to Typst notes.

You can specify a logo, cover and ToC_depth in your `myst.yml` file.

```yaml
  options:
    logo: logo.svg    // replace with your own logo, at top of the paper
    cover: Cover.PNG  // replace with your own cover image
    ToC_depth: 2      // set depth of the table of contents, 2 by default
```

The cover will be placed on the cover page, the logo will be placed in the header of each page.
